IoT Watering System: The idea is that a farmer will have a number of water pumps on their farm that ensures that there is a steady flow of water for irrigation or livestock. As the farms can be quite vast, especially in places like Australia, the system will allow the farmer to monitor that all water pumps are working successfully or provide a notification when they are malfunctioning.
